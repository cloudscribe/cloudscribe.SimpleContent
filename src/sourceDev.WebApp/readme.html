                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Login Credentials</strong>
                        When you first run the project application an administrative user account will be created automatically with the email admin@admin.com
                        and the password admin. Once you login with administrative permissions a new Administration menu will appear, you should take a look around
                        the various menu items to find the configurable settings that are of interest to you. One of the first things you should do is change the email
                        address and password of the admin user account.  You can change the email under Administration > User Management > User List.
                        You can change the password by clicking the welcome user message at the top of the page. Be careful not to forget your password at least until
                        you have configured SMTP settings for email because password reset emails can't be sent until you do that.
                        If you deploy the application to public facing web hosting be sure to change these credentials immediately after deployment.

                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Data Protection</strong>
                        Be sure to see the comments in Startup.cs about data protection and how to configure the storage location of data protection keys.
                        Data protection keys are used to encrypt some settings that are persisted to data storage such as the password for SMTP, and the "secrets"
                        for social authentication.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Configure Email Settings for email notifications</strong>
                        In order for certain features like password reset or requiring a confirmed email to work, your site needs to be able to send email notifications.
                        You will find settings for this under Administration > Email Settings
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Build your own custom features</strong>
                        Now that your project is created, you likely have plans to write some code for the custom features you need. cloudscribe doesn't impose
                        any prescriptive requirements or patterns for how you build your own features, you can typically use any patterns and approaches
                        that you would normally use in ASP.NET Core. But there is some guidance provided for getting the current user information and how to
                        optionally implement multi-tenancy in your own features if you need that.
                        See the <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/building-custom-features-that-integrate-with-cloudscribe-core?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-allstorage">Building Custom Features Documentation</a>
                        for more information.
                    </li>

                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Create a Custom theme</strong>
                        There are a bunch of bootswatch themes included and you can choose the theme from a dropdown list under Administration > Site Settings after you login to your project.
                        But more than likely you will want to create a custom theme.
                        You will want to customize the sass files under app-scss, and
                        the _Layout.cshtml file under sitefiles/s1/themes/custom1/Shared. For example look in the _variables.scss file for $navbar-inverse-bg:
                        which controls the background color of the top navigation. Change the color and refresh the page and it should change right away because
                        we have a gulp task for hot reloading.
                        See the <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/themes-and-web-design?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-allstorage">Themes and Web Design</a>
                        documentation for more information.
                    </li>

                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Configuration Sources</strong>
                        By default, the configuration system will let you override appsettings.json from appsettings.Development.json when the environment is Development.
                        It's best to avoid putting any sensitive information directly in appsettings.json because you will likely want to include that file in source control.
                        You can copy any settings from appsettings.json into appsettings.Development.json instead of putting anything sensitive in appsettings.json.
                        We generally add appsettings.Development.json to the .gitignore file so that any connection strings or credentials won't go into source control.
                        It also supports overriding appsettings.json with appsettings.Production.json if the environment is Production. We don't include an
                        appsettings.Production.json file in the template, and would create that file manually on the production server as part of the first deployment.
                        For Azure hosting you would generally use Environment Variables or Azure Key Vault as discussed in the
                        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration?tabs=basicconfiguration">official documentation</a>.

                        <strong>Google Analytics</strong>
                        cloudscribe has built in support for Google Analytics - just add your profile id under Administration > Site Settings.
                        There is also tracking of account activities such as site registration and logins, including social login tracking.
                        To get the most benefit from Google Analytics, see the <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/google-analytics-integration?utm_source=projecttemplate&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=newproject-allstorage">documentation</a>.

                    <h2>Check out our commercial cloudscribe modules</h2>

                    <p>cloudscribe commercial libraries are published as nuget packages just like <a href="/docs/complete-list-of-cloudscribe-libraries">our open source libraries</a>. You can find <a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/cloudscribe">all of our libraries on nuget.org</a>, the open source libraries have blue icons and the commercial libraries have green icons. The easiest way to get our products is by using our <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joeaudette.cloudscribeProjectTemplate">Project Template for Visual Studio</a>, which can create an application configured with our open source and commercial libraries in various configurations based on the options you choose. We also have reference sample applications on github that show how to wire up the nuget packages in case you want to integrate our products with existing web applications. You can find links to the reference applications in the list below and in the product details listed in <a href="/store">our&nbsp;store</a>. All of our commercial products are released under our <a href="https://www.cloudscribe.com/CommercialProductLicense.md" target="_blank">commercial product license</a>.</p>

                    <p>Some of our commercial libraries can be used with any ASP.NET Core MVC application and do not require cloudscribe Core, but all of our commercial libraries work optimally when used with our open source libraries.</p>

                    <p>We put a lot of effort into all of our products both open source and commercial, but we depend on sales of our commercial products to support our continued work.</p>
